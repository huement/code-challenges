-------- Initial Prompt --------------------------

Role: You are a Senior Product Engineer specializing in React Native and UX Design.

Goal: Build a "delightful" mobile-first, two-page application for reviewing tennis courts using React Native (Expo) and TypeScript.

Tech Stack Requirements:

Framework: React Native (via Expo Router or React Navigation).

Language: TypeScript.

Styling: StyleSheet or NativeWind (Tailwind) — keep it clean and performant.

Icons: Lucide-React-Native or Ionicons.

App Structure & Features:

1. Data Model (Mock Data):

Create a comprehensive mock data file (courts.ts) containing at least 5 tennis courts.

Each court should have: id, name, address, rating (1-5 float), reviewCount, image (use high-quality Unsplash source URLs), amenities (array of strings like "Lights", "Clay", "Pro Shop"), and an array of reviews (user, comment, rating).

2. Screen 1: The "Court Finder" (Home View)

Layout: A beautiful, clean header welcoming the user.

Search: A prominent, pill-shaped search bar at the top with a search icon. This must filter the list of courts in real-time by name or location.

List: A scrollable list of "Court Cards".

Card Design: Each card must be visually "delightful"—use rounded corners (borderRadius: 16), subtle shadows (elevation), and a high-quality background image. Display the name, a star icon with the rating, and the distance/address clearly.

Interaction: Tapping a card navigates to the Detail View.

3. Screen 2: The "Court Insight" (Detail View)

Hero Section: A large header image of the court with a "Back" button overlay.

Info Section: Display the court name, total rating, and a horizontal scroll of "chips" for amenities.

Reviews Section: A list of existing user reviews.

Action: A floating action button (FAB) or a clearly visible button to "Leave a Review".

Review Logic: Clicking "Leave a Review" should open a simple form (Modal or inline). Users can input a rating and text. Upon submit, update the local state to reflect the new review immediately (optimistic UI).

Design Philosophy ("Delight"):

Use a color palette inspired by tennis (Deep Forest Green: #2C5F2D, Court Blue: #0066CC, Lime Accent: #CCFF00).

Ensure touch targets are large (min 44px).

Add subtle press animations (e.g., cards scale down slightly on press).

Execution Steps:

Initialize the project structure.

Create the types and mock data.

Implement the navigation.

Build the screens with the "Delight" design principles.

Ensure the "Add Review" functionality works in the local session.



-------- Enhancement Prompt --------------------------

Task: Scale Data & Implement Pagination

We need to stress-test the UI with a larger dataset. Please update the app with the following changes:

1. Data Generation (courts.ts):

Refactor the mock data to export an array of 60 tennis courts.

Smart Image Logic: Instead of manually pasting URLs, write a generation function:

For the first 10 courts, use specific, high-quality Unsplash tennis URLs (so the initial view looks perfect).

For the remaining 50 courts, use a placeholder image service (e.g., https://placehold.co/600x400/2C5F2D/FFFFFF?text=Court+${id}) or a generic local asset.

Text Data: Programmatically generate names (e.g., "Downtown Courts #45") and random ratings (3.0 - 5.0) for the bulk items.

2. UI & Performance:

Update the Home Screen's FlatList.

Pagination: Implement client-side pagination. Initially load only 10 items.

Infinite Scroll: Use the onEndReached and onEndReachedThreshold props to automatically load the next batch of 10 courts as the user scrolls down.

Add a small "Loading..." spinner in the ListFooterComponent when fetching the next page.
